# Data Structures and Algorithms Implemented in C

This is a collection of small programs I used to learn about basic data
structures and algorithms and their implementation in C. Along with the programs
themselves, there is also a shell script that uses the ss program to run an
experiment. The details of this experiment are in the Experiment folder.

## Programs

bst - a program for demonstrating the Binary Search Tree data structure.
clist - a program for demonstrating the Circularly-Linked List data structure.
dlist - a program for demonstrating the Doubly-Linked List data structure.
htb - a program for demonstrating the Hash Table data structure.
q - a program for demonstrating the Queue data structure.
slist - a program for demonstrating the Singly-Linked List data structure.
ss - a program for testing Searching and Sorting algorithms.
stack - a program for demonstrating the Stack data structure.
